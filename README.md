Hello there. We are so glad you decided to look at the README for this ameeeezing project that Anne and Maigen worked so hard on.  This program is CRITICAL to the success of any post-apocalyptic survival plan. It's dark out there. Take this.

In this stupendous piece of programming, Maigen and Anne created a new dictionary. You can add WORDS to it. It SAVES those words.  Then you can save DEFINITIONS to those words.

Mind. Blown.

also, it's only half functional at the moment. Stay tuned.
